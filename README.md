Hello, I am an OSINT specialist.
In this profile you can find some scripts I use to help me in my investigations. 
While most of the scripts that I write involve tools and/or data connected to my job and thus cannot be made public, I do have some scripts that will published on this profile.
Many of my scripts have been written as Maltego transforms, but can be easily adjusted to be used outside of Maltego.

It is my beleif that any investigative task that you do more than twice in an investigation, should have an automation that does it for you.
The goal should alsways be to do as little mundane work as possible in order to build efficiency in your investigative process.
